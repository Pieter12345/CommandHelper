		<h3>General</h3>
		<p>
			The MethodScript website supports localization efforts, to better serve communities that are primarily non-English
			speaking. While much of the application itself is necessarily written in English (function names, etc would be a
			disaster to try to localize), the documentation for the application does not necessarily need to be in English.
		</p><p>
			To this end, a Localization (or L10n) framework has been put in place to facilitate bilingual localizers to help
			translate the documentation into languages other than English! Much care has been put into ensuring the accuracy of
			the documentation, and the language of it is no exception. General help for the localization framework can
			be found on the website <a href="%%wiki|Localization%%">here</a>, and you should be familiar with that
			before using this tool, but this help file describes use of the tool itself.
		</p><p>
			In order to use this program, you must have git installed and available on your path. For instructions on
			how to install this, see <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">the git
			installation guide</a>.
		</p><p>
			There are two main workflows when doing localization, the categorization workflow, and the translation
			workflow. Before a segment may be translated, it must first be categorized. Categorization is simply the
			act of ensuring whether or not the segment itself is appropriate, that is, ensuring that the original
			English is correct, and that the segementation logic behaved correctly. It is also about categorizing it
			as machine translatable or not. To complete categorization, review the original English, and ensure it is
			correct. If it is untranslatable, because it is for instance, completely a technical string, mark it as
			untranslatable, and the categorization is done. This prevents translation of the segment in any locale.
			Similarly, if the English is incorrect, or the segmentation logic was wrong, and this segment has something
			wrong with the original English in such a way that it should be fixed, mark the segment as "suspect", which
			prevents the segment from being translated in any locale, and flags the segment to be reviewed by
			developers. Due to the way the segmentation logic works, this should not be translated, as segments can't be
			changed. Changing the text of a segment creates a brand new segment, but the old segment remains in the
			database until manually removed later. Finally, the segment should be reviewed for suitability for machine
			translation. If the segment partially contains technical strings that are plain words, but shouldn't be
			translated for technical reasons, then the segment should be marked as not eligible for machine translation.
		</p><p>
			Once the segment is fully categorized, this unlocks the translation panel for all locales. Each segment must
			be reviewed before it can be localized, but this review only needs to happen once to unlock it in all
			locales. There are filters available to help guide these workflows, depending on what you've set out to do.			
		</p><p>
			There are 4 filters, in addition to the one that shows all segments, and are intended to support the
			following workflows:
		</p><ul>
			<li>Show Untranslated - Shows the segments that do not have either a machine translation or manual
			translation. This also shows uncategorized segments, so in order to do the translation, you will
			have to categorize the segment first. Segments that have been categorized, but have been determined
			to not need a translation due to the fact that they are untranslatable or a suspect segment are removed
			from this view.</li>
			<li>Show Uncategorized - Shows the segments that have not yet been categorized. This is all segments that
			have not been marked as untranslatable, not been marked as suspect, and are still marked as uncategorized
			in the eligible for machine translation category.</li>
			<li>Show Suspect - This is mostly meant for the developer view, to quickly see all the suspect segments, so
			that the original English can be easily identified to be fixed.</li>
			<li>Show Translatable - Shows all segments that can be translated, whether they have a translation or not
			already (including a machine translation.) This workflow is useful for reviewing existing translations for
			correctness, but also being able to provide new ones where missing. This is the usual workflow when editing
			individual pages.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Fork Repository</h3>
		<p>
			Before the system can be used, you must fork the primary repository, and create a local copy. Go to
			Tools->Fork Database... to launch the fork tool, which will help you get a repository initially set up.
		</p>

		<h3>Allowing Machine Translations</h3>
		<p>
			To use the machine translation features of the tool, a subscription to the Azure Cognitive Services
			must be set up. More information about how to sign up for an account and subscription can be found
			<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/">here</a>. While paid subscriptions
			exist, there is a free tier, which can be used in limited amounts per month. Once a subscription to
			Cognitive Services is set up, the key and endpoint can be found under Resource Management -> Quick Start. 
			These values can be copied into the tool under Tools->Add Azure Key. You can choose to store the values
			to your computer, so they don't need to be re-entered every time, but do keep in mind that they are stored
			in plain text in your local persistence network, so it may be unwise to do so.
