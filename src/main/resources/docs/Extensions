Extensions are a way to extend MethodScript using native Java code. Extensions can add a number of types of
functionality, from new functions and events, to new commandline tools.

While the extension framework is officially supported, no individual extensions are themselves officially supported.
Extension developers do not need to register with the project, and there is no central repository of extensions, so
it isn't possible to say what extensions are out there. A number of extensions can be found 
[https://letsbuild.net/jenkins/ here], but note that this is not exhaustive, and is a community supported effort.

{{TakeNote|text=Note that extensions completely bypass the security restrictions in place in MethodScript, and therefore
should be carefully installed, and only downloaded from trusted sources.}}

In order to install extensions, simply drop the jar into the extensions folder, in your MethodScript installation, and
restart. The extensions will be automatically loaded from there.

Extensions can provide access to any features that can be provided in Java, and so can therefore be quite powerful. If
you're interested in developing your own extension, see the page on [[Extension_Development|Extension Development]].
